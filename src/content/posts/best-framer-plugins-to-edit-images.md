Speaking of retro effects, the [ASCII plugin](/plugins/ascii) takes things to another level by converting your images and text into ASCII art. If you've ever seen pictures made entirely of text characters, that's exactly what this plugin does - and it does it brilliantly.

Beyond just images, you can also transform regular text into ASCII-style typography. This opens up loads of creative possibilities for headers, decorative elements, or even entire backgrounds. 

The plugin gives you control over typography settings like font size and spacing, so you can fine-tune your ASCII art to perfection.
