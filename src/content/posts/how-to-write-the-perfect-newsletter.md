Whether you're looking to start a newsletter or improve your existing one - you're in the right place!

In this article we'll talk about creating an effective newsletter template that will keep your readers coming back for more. Let's break it down into simple steps that anyone can follow.

But first, let's talk about why having a good template is crucial.

A well-designed template helps you:

- Save time when creating each issue
- Keep your content organized
- Make your newsletter look professional
- Improve readability for your audience

Now, let's get into the six key sections that make up a great newsletter.

## The Intro

Your introduction is like the cover of a book â€“ it needs to make people want to read more.

Here's what to include:

- A catchy headline
- A brief overview of what's inside
- Maybe a fun fact or question to spark curiosity

**Pro tip:** consider adding a bulleted list of topics to give readers a quick preview.

## The Curated Content

This section is where you become the cool friend who always knows what's up.

Share the good stuff:

- Interesting news articles
- Helpful resources
- Trending topics in your niche

**Pro tip:** Rremember to add your own thoughts or takeaways. This personal touch is what sets your newsletter apart from a simple list of links.

## The Ad Zone

Yes, you can (and should) promote stuff in your newsletter.

But keep it short:

- Limit this section to about 100 words
- Promote your product, service, or a sponsor
- Make sure it's relevant to your audience

## Your Original Content

This is where you can shine!

Create content that:

- Educates, informs, or entertains your readers
- Tells a story or shares your expertise
- Keep it under 1000 words (it should be a 5-minute read max)

**Pro tip:** remember, most people read newsletters on their phones so keep paragraphs short (2-3 lines).

## The Outro

Your outro is like the dessert of your newsletter meal.

You should be using it to:

- Recap key points
- Tease what's coming in the next issue
- Include a call-to-action (CTA) for your product or service

**Pro tip:** You can often use the same outro template for multiple issues, saving you time.

## The Feedback Section

You want to know what your readers really think so you can improve the next issues.

So add a quick poll at the end of your newsletter:

- Keep it simple (e.g., "How was this newsletter?" with 3-5 options)
- Aim for a 75% or higher positive rating
- Use the feedback to improve future issues

You can use tools like [Beehiiv](/beehiiv) to easily add polls, or create your own using images and a Google Form or Tally.

Creating a great newsletter doesn't have to be complicated.

By using this template and focusing on providing value to your readers, you'll be well on your way to newsletter success.

Remember, the key is consistency and knowing your audience.
As you get more comfortable with your template, you can start experimenting with AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT or even Perplexity to help with content creation. But that's a topic for another article!
