A person who signs up to receive regular updates from a newsletter. A subscriber is someone who has opted to receive content from a newsletter on an ongoing basis. 

This typically involves providing an email address to join a mailing list. Subscribers are the lifeblood of newsletters, as they represent an engaged audience interested in the content being shared.

For newsletter creators, growing and maintaining a subscriber base is crucial. It's not just about numbers, but about cultivating a community of readers who find value in the content. 

Effective newsletter strategies often focus on attracting new subscribers while keeping existing ones engaged and preventing unsubscribes.
