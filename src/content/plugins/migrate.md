Migrate is a Framer plugin that uses AI to adapt existing content to new website templates.

This tool analyses your current website or content needs and generates new content that fits seamlessly into your chosen Framer template. It aims to streamline the process of creating and customizing website content.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- AI-powered content generation: automatically creates new content based on your existing website or description.
- Template compatibility: ensures generated content fits the structure and style of your chosen Framer template.
- Flexible input: use a URL or provide a brief description of your content needs.
- Partial updates: select specific portions of a page to update, allowing for more targeted content migration.
- Multiple source options: use different website pages as sources for various components of your Framer site.

For Framer designers, Migrate is a time-saving tool that simplifies the often tedious process of adapting content to new templates. It provides a solid starting point for website content, allowing designers to focus more on fine-tuning and personalizing their sites rather than starting from scratch.
