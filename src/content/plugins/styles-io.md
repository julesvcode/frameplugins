Styles IO is a handy Framer plugin that lets you move your text and colour styles between different projects with ease. This clever tool saves you loads of time by making style management a breeze, letting you keep your designs consistent across multiple projects without the faff of manual copying.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Easy Style Export: export all your text and colour styles to a JSON file with just a couple of clicks.
- Flexible Import Options: choose whether to import colours, text styles, or both, giving you complete control over what you bring into your project.
- Smart Style Updates: the plugin automatically updates existing styles and adds new ones, making sure your project stays organised.
- Style Backup: keep a backup of your styles that you can use to undo changes whenever needed.
- Advanced Matching Options: use the 'Match by ID' feature to restore renamed styles, making it easier to manage style updates.
- Seamless Integration: works smoothly within Framer, requiring no extra software or complicated setup.

Styles IO is a massive time-saver for designers working across multiple Framer projects, making style management feel like a walk in the park. It's particularly brilliant for teams who need to maintain consistent branding across different projects and want to avoid the tedious task of manually copying styles.
