JSON Sync is a Framer plugin that allows you to import and export your CMS collections with JSON files. This handy tool makes it a breeze to manage your data outside of Framer, backup or move your data, and even use your CMS content with other tools that may not support CSV files.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- Seamless Data Transfer: upload a .json file, drag and drop, or simply paste from the clipboard to instantly add items to your collection.
- Conflict Resolution: any conflicts, such as items with the same slug as an existing item, are resolved through an easy-to-use interface.
- Backup and Restore: easily backup your CMS data by exporting it as a JSON file, which you can then import back into Framer whenever needed.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: JSON files are widely supported, allowing you to use your CMS content with various tools that may not work with CSV files.
- Time-Saving Efficiency: manage your data outside of Framer at your convenience, then import it back into your project with a few clicks.

JSON Sync streamlines the process of working with your CMS data, making it a valuable asset for any designer using Framer. Whether you need to backup your data, move it between projects, or integrate it with other tools, this plugin has got you covered.
