Stay organised while designing with this handy to-do list plugin that lets you manage tasks without leaving your Framer workspace. 

The plugin seamlessly integrates with your design workflow, allowing you to add, edit, and complete tasks directly on the canvas while keeping your workspace clean and distraction-free.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Quick Task Entry: add new tasks instantly by typing and hitting Enter or clicking the "+" icon, making it effortless to capture your ideas and to-dos while designing.
- Automatic Saving: never lose track of your tasks thanks to real-time updates that save your list automatically, ensuring your tasks remain intact even when you close and reopen Framer.
