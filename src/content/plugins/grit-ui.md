The Grit UI Framer plugin offers a collection of production-ready sections, components, and forms, saving you valuable time and ensuring consistent design across your projects.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- Ready-to-go Forms: built using Framer Forms, these forms provide a seamless user experience, enabling you to add contact or sign-up forms in seconds.
- Highly Customisable: you have complete control over every aspect of the design. Tweak elements via Framer properties or detach layers for custom edits directly on the canvas.
- Theme Switcher: changing the theme for one or multiple components or sections is a breeze, making it easier than ever to maintain a consistent design or experiment with new looks.
- Production-Ready Components: from heroes to footers and testimonials, Grit UI offers a wide range of optimised components specifically designed for website projects.
- Efficiency Boost: say goodbye to recreating the same design elements for every project. With Grit UI, you can focus on what truly matters â€“ elevating your design skills.

Grit UI is an invaluable tool for anyone designing in Framer, streamlining the process and empowering you to create stunning websites with ease. Its flexibility and comprehensive feature set make it a must-have addition to your design arsenal.
