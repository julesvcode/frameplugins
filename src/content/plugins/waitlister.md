The Waitlister plugin helps you create professional waitlist forms for your Framer website without any coding knowledge. Whether you're preparing a product launch or testing new ideas, this free plugin makes collecting user interest straightforward and effective.

Building a waitlist before launching your product or service gives you a significant advantage. Instead of starting from scratch when you go live, you'll already have an audience of people genuinely interested in what you're offering.

## Key features and benefits:

- Quick setup process: add waitlist forms to any Framer page in just a few minutes, no technical skills required
- Multiple form layouts: choose between inline forms (email and button in one row) or multi-field forms that include name and phone number options
- Complete customisation control: adjust button colours, placeholder text, and success messages directly through Framer's property panel
- Idea validation: test whether people actually want your product before spending months developing it
- Built-in audience growth: collect email addresses from interested users who are more likely to become customers when you launch

The plugin connects to your Waitlister account (free plan available) where you can manage all submissions through a clean dashboard. You can set up different success behaviours, like showing an inline thank-you message or redirecting users to a custom page after they sign up.

This plugin is particularly useful for Framer designers who want to build anticipation for their projects whilst maintaining full control over the visual design and user experience of their waitlist forms.
