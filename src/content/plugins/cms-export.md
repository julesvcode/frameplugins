This tool bridges the gap between Framer and other software by allowing easy data export. It's perfect for designers who need to work with their Framer data outside the platform.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Easy exporting: turn any Framer collection into a CSV file with just a few clicks.
- Preview function: check your data before exporting to make sure everything looks right.
- Project transfers: use exported CSVs to move collections between different Framer projects.
- Data backup: create backups of your collections to keep your work safe.
- External tool compatibility: work with your Framer data in spreadsheet software or other apps.

For Framer designers, CMS Export is a game-changer. It makes managing and sharing data much easier, allowing for smoother workflows and better collaboration with team members who might not use Framer.
