Content Pilot is an advanced writing assistant that brings the power of AI directly into your Framer workflow. It replaces specific text layers or populates entire CMS collections with realistic, high-quality content, saving you from the tedium of "Lorem Ipsum".

Whether you need a punchy headline, a full blog post, or accurate product descriptions, this plugin uses context-aware AI to generate copy that fits your design perfectly. It supports a "Bring Your Own Key" model, ensuring privacy and flexibility.

<b>Key features:</b>
- **Layer Generation:** Instantly rewrite selected text layers with specific tones (e.g., Professional, Witty) and context awareness.
- **CMS Population:** Automatically fill your database fields like "Bio" or "Price" with rich, varied content in bulk.
- **BYOK Flexibility:** Connect your own API keys from OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude 3.5), Google Gemini, or Mistral AI.
- **Privacy First:** Your API keys are encrypted and stored locally on your device, never sent to external servers.
- **Multi-Model Support:** Switch between different AI models to find the perfect writing style for your brand voice.

It's a powerful tool for designers and copywriters who want to see their designs come to life with real, meaningful content.

**Created by Launchly**, this plugin puts robust AI content generation right at your fingertips.
