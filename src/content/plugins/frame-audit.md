Frame Audit is a quality assurance plugin that helps Framer creators audit their templates against marketplace requirements and performance standards. This all-in-one tool combines marketplace compliance checking with Google PageSpeed Insights integration, allowing designers to test and optimise their work without switching between different applications.

## Key features and benefits:

- Marketplace Requirements Check: automatically scans your template against official Framer Marketplace rules, catching issues like missing meta tags, broken links, and accessibility problems before submission
- Integrated Performance Testing: runs Google PageSpeed Insights tests directly within Framer, giving you speed scores and optimisation suggestions without opening external tools
- Responsiveness Verification: tests how your template performs across different screen sizes and devices to ensure consistent user experience
- SEO and Accessibility Audit: reviews your template for proper heading structure, alt text, and other elements that improve search rankings and user accessibility
- Real-time Quality Feedback: provides clear pass/fail breakdowns with specific recommendations, making it easy to identify and fix issues quickly
- Template Submission Confidence: Reduces the risk of marketplace rejection by ensuring all requirements are met before publishing

Frame Audit streamlines the quality assurance process for Framer creators who want to publish professional templates on the marketplace. The plugin eliminates guesswork by providing concrete feedback on both compliance and performance, helping designers ship better work faster.
