Framer Commerce is a powerful Framer plugin that allows you to design and launch your dream e-commerce store or template directly within Framer, while seamlessly managing all your products on Shopify. This integration keeps everything in perfect sync between the two platforms, unlocking their full potential.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- Powerful CMS Integration: seamlessly sync your Shopify storefront data, including products, prices, images, descriptions, tags, collections, and more.
- Product Components: Framer Commerce provides a range of customisable product components, such as a Purchase Button with different states, a Variant Selector for scalable variant selection, and many more.
- Live Stock Status: monitor and display live stock status based on your customised conditions.
- Cart Components: manage the entire cart experience with a Cart State Controller (for both empty and populated states), Dynamic Cart Product Cards, a Cart Overlay Trigger connected to the Purchase Button, and a Live Cart Counter for real-time cart status.
- Localisation: Framer Commerce supports localisation, allowing you to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers around the globe.

Framer Commerce empowers designers to create visually stunning and fully functional e-commerce experiences within the familiar Framer environment, while leveraging the power of Shopify's robust e-commerce platform.
