The AI Rewrite plugin allows you to update text and modify attributes across multiple layers with a simple prompt. It's a real time-saver when working on content-heavy projects or maintaining design systems.

This plugin harnesses the power of AI to streamline your workflow within Framer. Just select the layers you want to change, feed your instructions to the AI, and let it work its magic.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Duplicate content precisely: whether you need to replicate sections or generate variations, the AI replicates your content flawlessly.
- Remove unwanted elements easily: cluttered designs? No problem. AI Rewrite can identify and remove unnecessary elements.
- Update text across multiple layers: change body text, headings, labels etc. simultaneously with a single prompt.
- Modify attributes like font styles or colours: transform the look and feel of your designs by altering attributes en masse. 
- Adapt content for different contexts: rephrase descriptions, shorten text, or tailor content to suit new purposes.
- Maintain consistency in design systems: keep components uniform by batch editing properties adhering to your guidelines.

AI Rewrite streamlines repetitive tasks, giving you more time to focus on the core creative work. It's an invaluable addition to any Framer designer's toolbox.
