The Pomodoro Timer plugin is a simple tool to help you stay focused whilst working in Framer. It brings the popular Pomodoro technique directly into your design environment, so you don't need to switch between apps to manage your time.

This plugin allows you to set focus intervals and breaks, helping you maintain a healthy workflow. It's designed to be unobtrusive, sitting quietly on your canvas until you need it.

<b>Key features:</b>
- **Flexible Timing:** Customise your focus sessions (1–60 mins), short breaks, and long breaks to suit your rhythm.
- **Two Views:** Choose between a full circular timer or a compact bar that takes up less space.
- **Session Tracking:** Keep track of how many focus sessions you've completed in a day. The count resets at midnight.
- **Thoughtful Details:** Features like auto-start for seamless transitions and optional sound notifications.
- **Accessible:** Built with keyboard navigation and screen reader support in mind.

It's a straightforward way to boost your productivity and keep your creative flow interrupted only when you want it to be.

**Created by Sanna Granqvist**, this plugin is designed to fit naturally into your workflow, even adapting to your current Framer theme.
