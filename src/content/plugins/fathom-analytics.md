Fathom Analytics is a straightforward, privacy-focused website analytics tool for your Framer site. It's a better alternative to Google Analytics.

This plugin allows you to effortlessly integrate Fathom Analytics into your Framer projects. No need to edit the header code in your Framer site's head section – just plug and play.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- Simple to use and quick to understand, unlike complex tools like Google Analytics.
- Respects visitor privacy and complies with GDPR regulations.
- Offers unlimited data retention, allowing you to view your stats forever.
- Trusted by governments, banks, small businesses, and bloggers alike.
- Provides an importer to save your Universal Analytics and GA4 data.

To start collecting stats with this plugin, you'll need a Fathom Analytics subscription, with plans starting from £10.50/month. Unlike other analytics tools, Fathom doesn't generate revenue from your visitors' data. Instead, they charge a fair price for their privacy-first service.

Fathom Analytics makes website analytics a breeze, especially for designers working in Framer. Its user-friendly interface and privacy-focused approach make it an excellent choice for those seeking a hassle-free analytics solution.
