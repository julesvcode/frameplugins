This handy plugin solves the common problem of losing track of assets in larger projects. Simply copy an asset's URL from the Usage tab in Framer, paste it into the plugin, and it'll show you every instance where that asset appears across your entire project.

## Key features and benefits:

- Quick asset searching: find any asset instantly by pasting its framerusercontent.com URL into the plugin
- Project-wide visibility: see all instances where your asset appears across different pages and components
- Simple workflow integration: works directly with Framer's existing Usage tab for a seamless experience
- Time-saving organisation: no more manually hunting through pages to locate specific images, icons, or files
- Free to use: available at no cost with regular updates from creator Kye
- Easy installation: one-click setup from the Framer Marketplace with no complex configuration needed

Asset Locator is particularly useful for designers working on complex projects with multiple assets who need better organisation tools. It streamlines the process of managing and locating resources, making your Framer workflow more efficient and less frustrating.
