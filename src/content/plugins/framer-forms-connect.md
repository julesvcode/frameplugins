## Overview
Framer Forms Connect is a game-changer for marketers and designers who want to maintain complete control over their form design while leveraging powerful backend services.

- **No Middleware Required:** Data is sent directly from your site to your provider (e.g., HubSpot or Mailchimp) without passing through Zapier or Make.
- **Privacy Centric:** Helps maintain GDPR compliance by reducing third-party data handlers.
- **Broad Support:** Works with HubSpot, Mailchimp, Brevo, [Beehiiv](/beehiiv), MailerLite, Jotform, and Discord.
