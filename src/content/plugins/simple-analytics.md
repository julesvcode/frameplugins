Simple Analytics is an EU-based website analytics tool that provides clean insights without tracking individual users or using cookies. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Framer, allowing you to add website analytics to your projects with just a few clicks.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- No cookie banners needed: the tool doesn't use cookies or track personal data, so you can skip those annoying consent pop-ups that clutter your site
- GDPR compliant by design: built with European privacy standards in mind, meaning you won't have legal headaches about data protection
- Lightweight script: the analytics code is tiny and won't slow down your website or hurt your performance scores
- Simple dashboard: unlike Google Analytics 4's confusing interface, you get straightforward stats that actually make sense
- One-click setup: no coding or complicated configuration required - just add the plugin and analytics start working immediately
- Clean insights: focus on the metrics that matter without getting lost in endless data you don't need

Simple Analytics makes website tracking hassle-free for Framer users who want insights without the privacy concerns or complexity of traditional analytics tools. It's perfect for designers who need to understand their site's performance without becoming data analysts.
