Pseudo Cart is a lightweight Framer plugin that lets you build fast, free, and fully private checkout flows â€” no payments or third-party integrations required.

Perfect for scenarios where you need a checkout-style flow but aren't processing transactions, such as taking quotes, pre-orders, sample requests, or service bookings. Seamlessly connect to your CMS collections and redirect orders to email, Google Sheets, or any custom endpoint using Framer's native forms.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Build realistic checkout experiences without handling payments
- Fully customisable and integrates with your existing designs
- Connect to CMS collections for product data
- Redirect orders to email, Google Sheets, or custom endpoints
- Lightweight and doesn't require third-party integrations
- Free and open-source

Whether you're creating a prototype for a new e-commerce site or building a simple booking system, Pseudo Cart streamlines the process, allowing you to focus on the design and user experience. Its flexibility and ease of use make it an invaluable tool for any Framer designer.
