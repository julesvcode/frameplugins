The Polar plugin brings simplicity to selling digital goods through your Framer site. This official integration streamlines setting up, managing and embedding products within your projects.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

Selling digital products can be convoluted, with separate systems for payments, keys, and file delivery. Polar neatly rolls those into one, letting you provide a professional, cohesive experience. For designers running an online store through Framer, it's a clean, modern solution.
