The Tally Framer plugin lets you easily embed beautiful Tally forms directly into your Framer projects without any coding.

Tally is a simple, Notion-like form builder that helps you create powerful forms for free. The Framer plugin makes it incredibly straightforward to add these forms to your designs with just a few clicks.

## Key features and benefits:

- One-click embedding: simply paste your Tally form URL and the plugin handles the rest automatically
- Full customisation control: show or hide form titles and backgrounds, plus choose between left or centre alignment
- Completely responsive: forms automatically adapt to different screen sizes and devices seamlessly
- No coding required: everything works through a simple interface without needing any technical knowledge
- Instant publishing: forms appear immediately in your Framer design and start collecting responses straight away
- Versatile form types: perfect for contact forms, feedback collection, sign-ups, surveys, and custom forms
- Real-time updates: the plugin properly re-renders when you make changes to form settings

This plugin is brilliant for Framer designers who want to add functional forms without the hassle of complex integrations. It bridges the gap between Tally's powerful form-building capabilities and Framer's design flexibility perfectly.
