The FramerShop plugin creates a commerce layer within Framer, allowing you to import product data, bind it to your components, and publish your store without ever leaving the design environment. Rather than starting with rigid templates, you can design your ideal shop layout first, then bring it to life with real product information.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>
- Design-first workflow: start with your perfect layout rather than being limited by pre-built templates
- Live product data integration: work with actual product information while designing, eliminating placeholder content
- Drag-and-drop field binding: connect product data to components instantly without writing code or creating schemas
- Seamless synchronisation: keep your product information up-to-date by re-running the plugin to refresh items
- CMS collection support: import products directly into Framer's CMS collections for easy management
- Demo template included: try out the functionality with a complete demo project and sample data
- Real-time updates: maintain confidence that your live site reflects current product information

The plugin connects your Framer project to your FramerShop catalogue, making it simple to create product lists, detail pages, and galleries that stay synchronised with your inventory.

FramerShop bridges the gap between creative design freedom and e-commerce functionality, letting you focus on crafting beautiful shopping experiences rather than wrestling with technical limitations. It's particularly valuable for designers who want complete control over their store's appearance whilst maintaining the reliability of a proper commerce system.
