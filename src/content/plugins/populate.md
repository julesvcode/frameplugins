Populate is a Framer plugin that instantly fills your designs with realistic user data like names, emails, and phone numbers. This smart tool eliminates the tedious task of creating fake data manually, making it super easy to demonstrate your designs with authentic-looking content.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- Quick Data Generation: choose from different types of data (like names or emails) and fill your design with just one click.
- Multiple Data Types: get access to various data categories including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more - perfect for building user profiles or contact lists.
- Batch Processing: save time by applying data to multiple text layers at once instead of updating each field individually.
- Real-Looking Content: make your designs feel more professional with data that looks genuine rather than obvious placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum."
- Simple Interface: no complicated setup needed - just select your text layers, pick the type of data you want, and click to populate.

Populate is a game-changer for Framer designers who want to show their work in a professional way without spending hours creating fake user data. By making it super quick to add realistic content, you can focus on what really matters - making your designs look awesome.
