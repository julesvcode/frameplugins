Typeskale tackles one of the most tedious parts of web design â€“ setting up consistent typography across different screen sizes. Instead of manually adjusting font sizes, line heights, and spacing for every heading and body text, this plugin does the heavy lifting for you by creating a complete type system in just one click.

<b>Key features and benefits:</b>

- One-click generation: enter your desktop font sizes once and the plugin automatically calculates responsive styles for all breakpoints
- Complete heading hierarchy: creates H1 through H6 headings plus body text styles (XL to S sizes) that work seamlessly together
- Project-specific templates: choose from Landing Page, Ecommerce, Editorial, or SaaS templates to match your design's purpose and tone
- Smart responsive scaling: automatically adjusts typography for mobile, tablet, and desktop without any manual tweaking required
- Full customisation control: fine-tune fonts, weights, line heights, letter spacing, and other details before generating your type system
- Time-saving workflow: eliminates hours of manual font adjustments, letting you focus on the creative aspects of your design

Typeskale is particularly valuable for Framer users who want professional typography without the usual time investment. It ensures your text looks polished across all devices whilst freeing you up to concentrate on the more creative elements of your project.
