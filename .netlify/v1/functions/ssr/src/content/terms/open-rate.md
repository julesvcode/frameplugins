The percentage of subscribers who open a newsletter email. Open rate is a key metric that shows how many people are actually reading your newsletter. 

It's calculated by dividing the number of subscribers who opened an email by the total number of emails sent, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if you send a newsletter to 1000 people and 250 open it, your open rate is 25%.

This metric helps newsletter creators gauge the effectiveness of their subject lines and overall content appeal. A high open rate suggests that subscribers find your newsletter valuable and are eager to read it. 

It's worth noting that open rates can vary widely depending on factors like industry, audience, and email frequency. Monitoring your open rate, as well as your [click through rate](/terms/click-through-rate), over time can provide insights into what resonates with your readers and help you improve your newsletter strategy.
