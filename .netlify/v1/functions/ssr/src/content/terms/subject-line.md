The text that appears in the email header, briefly describing the email's content. The subject line is like a mini-headline for your newsletter. 

It's the first thing subscribers see in their inbox before opening your email. A good subject line should grab attention and give readers a clear idea of what to expect inside the newsletter.

Crafting effective subject lines is a crucial skill for newsletter creators. They need to be concise yet intriguing, informative but not boring. 

The right subject line can significantly boost open rates, while a poor one might mean your carefully crafted content goes unread. Many newsletter writers spend considerable time testing and refining their subject lines to find what works best for their audience.
