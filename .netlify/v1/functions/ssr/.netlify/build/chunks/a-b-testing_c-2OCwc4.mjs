In A/B testing, you create two slightly different versions of your newsletter and send each to a portion of your audience. \n\nThe goal is to determine which version gets better results, such as higher open rates or more clicks. For example, you might test two different subject lines, or two different layouts for your content.\n\nThis technique helps newsletter creators make data-driven decisions about their content and design. By systematically testing different elements, you can gradually improve your newsletter's performance over time (including [open rate](/terms/open-rate) and [click through rate](/terms/click-through-rate)). \n\nMany [email service providers](/categories/email-platform) offer built-in A/B testing tools, making it easy to experiment and learn what resonates best with your audience. Note that successful A/B testing often involves making small, focused changes rather than drastically altering your entire newsletter at once.";
